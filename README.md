## Installation

To run this project, you will need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. You can install the required packages using the following steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mnist-digit-classification.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd mnist-digit-classification
    ```
3. Create a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows:
        ```sh
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - On macOS and Linux:
        ```sh

    ```

## Usage

To run the notebook:

1. Start Jupyter Notebook:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
    ```
2. Open the `MNIST.ipynb` notebook from the Jupyter interface.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the cells and execute the code.

## Project Structure

- `MNIST.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook for the project.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of required Python packages.

## Notebook Contents

The `MNIST.ipynb` notebook includes the following sections:

1. **Introduction**: An overview of the MNIST dataset and the objectives of the notebook.
2. **Loading the Data**: Code to load the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow/Keras.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Steps to preprocess the data, including normalization and reshaping.
4. **Building the Model**: Defining the neural network architecture using Keras.
5. **Training the Model**: Code to train the model on the training data.
6. **Evaluating the Model**: Evaluating the model's performance on the test data.
7. **Making Predictions**: Using the trained model to make predictions on new data.
8. **Visualizing Results**: Visualizing the model's predictions and performance metrics.

### Example Usage

To execute the notebook, run the following commands in your terminal:

1. Start Jupyter Notebook:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
    ```
2. Open the `MNIST.ipynb` file by navigating through the Jupyter interface.
3. Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially by selecting the cell and clicking the "Run" button, or by pressing `Shift + Enter`.
